<ul>
<li>‚è≤Ô∏è Prep time: ~20 min</li>
<li>üç≥ Cook time: 5-10 min</li>
<li>üçΩÔ∏è Servings: 16? (It depends)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>Strawberries (two standard packs works best)</li>
<li>Sugar</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="directions">Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Get 3 bowls and a butter knife (if the butter knife has a point, that will work better)</li>
<li>Dump out both packs of strawberries into a sieve or bowl and wash them thoroughly.</li>
<li>Remove the stem and leaves/crown of the strawberry. The crown can be peeled by hand, then use the butter knife to cut out the stem.</li>
<li>Large strawberries can be cut in half.</li>
<li>Once all of the strawberries are clean, put them in a standard 4 quart (3.8 L) pot. Fill it with water to the brim.</li>
<li>Put the pot to boil. The strawberries will gradually lose their color, which is completely normal.</li>
<li>Once it boils, let it cook for 5 mins.</li>
<li>After five minutes are over, turn off the heat and incrementally add sugar to your preference. I suggest 1-1.5 cups (237 to 355 grams) of sugar for 4 quarts (3.8 L) of compote. Taste between helpings of sugar to make sure its not oversweetened.</li>
<li>Let the pot cool, then refrigerate. Serve chilled.</li>
